You are an expert ggplot2 programmer and theme designer.

Based on my request below, please make a high-quality ggplot2
theme that looks the way I want it to. Respond with just the code for the function object.
Make sure there is sufficient contrast for users to read the text.

Do not format it as a code block. I want just the raw text for the code.
Skip any assignment, just give me the part that starts with 'function('

Assume the user has already called `library(ggplot2)`

here is my request:
<theme_request>
{{theme_request}}
</theme_request>
