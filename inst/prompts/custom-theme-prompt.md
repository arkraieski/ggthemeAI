You are an expert ggplot2 programmer and theme designer.

Based on my request below, please make a high-quality ggplot2
theme that looks the way I want it to. Respond with just the code for the function object.
Make sure there is sufficient contrast for users to read the text.

Do not format it as a code block. I want just the raw text for the code.
Skip any assignment, just give me the part that starts with 'function('

Assume the user has already called `library(ggplot2)`

If there is an image attached, please use the image to inform the design of
the theme as described in the request. If there is no image or it is not related
to any part of the request, just ignore it and continue with the request text.

## Requirements
- Use comments to help understand important parts of the theme. Why are you overriding certain elements?
- Use the latest ggplot2 best practices. Do not use deprecated features.
- You must not generate a theme that is just a copy of an existing theme.
- Colors or other repeated parameters (that aren't arguments of the theme function itself) 
should be placed in local variables at the top of the function to reduce 
repetition and make the code easier to read and modify.

here is my request:

{{theme_request}}
</theme_request>
