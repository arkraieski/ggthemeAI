\title{Validate a ggplot2 Theme Function}
\usage{
check_theme(f)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A function expected to return a \code{ggplot2::theme} object. It must take no arguments.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if the function is valid. Otherwise, an error is thrown.
}
\description{
Checks whether a given function returns a valid \code{ggplot2} theme object when called with no arguments.
The function is executed in a separate R process to reduce risk.
}
\details{
This function is useful for validating dynamically generated theme functions,
such as those produced by \code{\link[=make_ai_theme]{make_ai_theme()}}. The function \code{f} is called inside a
subprocess using \code{\link[callr:r]{callr::r()}} to limit the risk of evaluating untrusted or erroneous code.
However, it's important to note that not all risk is mitigated.

The result must inherit from both \code{"theme"} and \code{"gg"}, as expected from objects
returned by standard \code{ggplot2} theme functions like \code{\link[ggplot2:ggtheme]{ggplot2::theme_minimal()}}.

Note that the theme function must not require any arguments (e.g., \code{base_size})
in order to be validated correctly.

\examples{
check_theme(ggplot2::theme_minimal)
